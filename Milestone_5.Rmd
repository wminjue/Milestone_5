## Anime: Rise of a Global Phenomenon 

First created in 1917 with propaganda films such as "Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei", Japanese animation (anime) swept the world in the 1980s as a global entertainment phenonemon with the rise of mecha, superhero series, and space operas. As the focus of anime shifted from film studio features such as Akira and Spirited Away, the format of popular anime transformed into increasingly long series consisting of shorter episodes —— bite sized-chunks which can be pitched as more accessible, lower commitment, and reduced-stakes trial runs to mold to ever-shifting popular opinion.

# Select comparitive data from MyAnimeList like # of start date(production release), score(on a scale of 1-10), number of members who voted to create the score, and other metrics like rank and popularity not found in basic nar dataset.

master <- merge(nar, rawanim, by.rawanim = "name") %>%

#Some of the scores and contributing voting members from the two datasets are not equal, so I created two new columns to take the data with biggest sample size. I created a new row called actmem, which returns the highest "contributing voting member" size from the two data sets.

    (master$scored_by > master$members)

#I create a line plot of the change in overall rank and the score of Naruto productions from the start of the franchise until 2016. I started out with a geom_line() plot, but it look too jagged and distracted from seeing overall trends, so I switched to smooth lines. I plotted a scatterplot of the rank and score over time, adjusting size based on how many members voted to track the size of the audience with each franchise. To fit both rank and score on the same scale, I divided rank by 1000 (since most of the later Naruto productions were in the 3000-4000). From the graphs, it looks like the scores of Naruto productions initally dipped in the late 2000s but is steadily increasing, while the overall rank has decreased when compared to all other anime productions, and the more recent productions are attracted a smaller group of dedicated fans (as measured by voting users).

ggplot() + geom_point(data = master, aes(x = start_date, y = actscor, color = "Score (1-10 Scale)", size = actmem)) + geom_smooth(data = master, se = F, aes(x = start_date, y = actscor, color = "Score (1-10 Scale)")) + geom_point(data = master, aes(x = start_date, y = rank/1000, color = "Rank (Divided by 1000)", size = actmem))+ geom_smooth(data = master, se = F, aes(x = start_date, y = rank/1000, color = "Rank (Divided by 1000)")) +  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) + scale_color_discrete(name = "Anime Metric") + labs(size = "Number of Users Providing Feedback", x = "Year of Anime Release", y = "Rank and Popularity", title = "Change in Rank and Popularity of Naruto Franchise Anime Productions by Release Date", subtitle = "Based on Compiled User Feedback on MyAnimeList from 2016-2017")
